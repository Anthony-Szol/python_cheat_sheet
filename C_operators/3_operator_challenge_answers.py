# Operator Challenge Answers

# Problem 1: 
# Write a Python function that takes two numbers as input 
# and returns their sum, difference, product.

# Variables
a = 4
b = 6

# Sum
print(a + b)

# Difference
print(a-b)

# Product
print(a*b)

# Problem 2:
# Find the remainder of variable c and d
c = 30
d = 19
print(c%d)

# Problem 3:
# Make the result true by comparing the following variables
e = 7
f = 3

print(e > f)
print(e >= f)
print(e != f)

# Problem 4: 
# Given the initial value, write a sequence of operations 
# using the assignment operators
g = 10

g += 15
print('After g += 15 =', g) 
# Increase g by 15, g is now 25

g *= 3   
print('After g *= 3 =', g)
# Multiply g by 3, g is now 75

g -= 2
print('After g -= 2 =', g)
# Reduce g by 2, g is now 73
