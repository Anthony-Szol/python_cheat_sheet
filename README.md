Findings
One thing that I found interesting was the skills required for both the entry level roles and highest paying roles. Both job types mentioned SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, and R in the same order. While the higher paying roles require a greater understand of the tools and languages, job seekers may want to continue improving these skills.

That being said, for those job seekers with a great understanding of the top 5 skills. Here are the top skills in demand and highest financial reward:

Achievements
